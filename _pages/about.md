Hi, my name is Bradley! I'm a mathematics and programming enthusiast with a deep passion for machine learning and numerical analysis. I studied mathematics at Durham University where in my fourth year found myself strongly drawn towards deep reinforcement learning. I currently reside in Grimsby, UK.

My hobbies primarily consist of gaming and programming but when I first researched into deep reinforcement learning - the natural intersection of these two areas - it quickly asserted itself chief among my interests. Nowadays, I believe that combining it with symbolic logical reasoning could be the next major stepping stone towards artificial general intelligence!

Through my education and hobbies I have gained a repertoire of technical skills. Focusing on programming languages, I am most adept at Python but I have also dabbled in C++, Julia and R. In order to fully understand complex programming algorithms like those used in deep learning and Bayesian inference, I worked my way up from the basics, starting with foundational concepts in programming and numerical analysis. This includes data structures and algorithms, numerical time integrators, neural networks and more.

As you might have guessed, I thoroughly enjoy the process behind problem-solving and get immense satisfaction when I finally understand something complex or figure out why something hasn't been working as intended. I'm also a big believer in learning by doing, so I'm always open to taking on new challenges, whether that's building something from scratch or exploring new programming languages.
